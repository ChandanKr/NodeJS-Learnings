//! HTTP HEADERS:
//* HTTP headers contain metadata in key-value pairs that are sent along with HTTP requests and responses.
//* HTTP headers carry additional information (context and metadata) for the request and response body.

//? HTTP Headers Creation:
// HTTP headers is created with the use of res.setHeader()

//? Syntax:
res.setHeader("key", "value"); // where key should be like "X-key" for good practice for custom headers
